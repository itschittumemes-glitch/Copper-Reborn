## Introduction

* Copper is a Minecraft: Java Edition launcher for Android based on [Boardwalk](https://github.com/zhuowei/Boardwalk), [PojavLauncher](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher) and [Amethyst Launcher](https://github.com/AngelAuraMC/Amethyst-Android).
* This launcher can launch almost all available Minecraft versions ranging from rd-132211 to 26.x snapshots (including Combat Test versions)
* Modding via Forge and Fabric are also supported.
* This repository contains source code for Android.

## Getting Copper

You can get Copper via three methods:

1. **Nightly** Download the latest artifact from [Nightly.link](https://nightly.link/CopperLauncher/Copper-Android/workflows/android/v3_openjdk?preview)
2. **Releases:** Download the latest prebuilt app [from Releases](https://github.com/CopperLauncher/Copper-android/releases/)
3. **Build from Source:** Follow the [building instructions](#building) below.

## Building

### Quick Build (Recommended)

The easiest way to build Copper is to use the pre-built JREs provided by our CI.

1. Clone the repository: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/CopperLauncher/Copper-Android.git`
2. Build the launcher: `./gradlew :app_pojavlauncher:assembleDebug` (Use `gradlew.bat` on Windows)

The built APK will be located in `app_pojavlauncher/build/outputs/apk/debug/`.

### Detailed Build

If you need more control over the build process, follow these steps:

1. **Java Runtime Environment (JRE):** Download the `jre8-pojav` artifact from AngelAuraMCs  [CI auto builds](https://github.com/AngelAuraMC/openjdk-build-multiarch/actions).  This package contains pre-built JREs for all supported architectures.  If you need to build the JRE yourself, follow the instructions in the [android-openjdk-build-multiarch](https://github.com/AngelAuraMC/openjdk-build-multiarch) repository.

2. **LWJGL:** The build instructions for the custom LWJGL are available over the [LWJGL repository](https://github.com/AngelAuraMC/lwjgl3).

3. **Language List:** Because languages are auto-added by Crowdin, you need to run the language list generator before building. In the project directory, run:
   * Linux/macOS:
     ```bash
     chmod +x scripts/languagelist_updater.sh
     bash scripts/languagelist_updater.sh
     ```
   * Windows:
     ```batch
     scripts\languagelist_updater.bat
     ```

4. **Build GLFW stub:** `./gradlew :jre_lwjgl3glfw:build`

5. **Build the launcher:** `./gradlew :app_pojavlauncher:assembleDebug` (Replace `gradlew` with `gradlew.bat` on Windows).
